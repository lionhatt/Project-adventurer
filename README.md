# Project-Adventurer
A MERN full-stack single page application for people enjoying the great outdoors! The application allows us to find important information on surrounding hiking trails, and interact with other users to plan hiking trip together.

## Installtion

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
